# Markdown

Markdown is a way to make fancy documents. 
Make sure that you "knit" often -- after every major change -- to mitigate errors.

Hashtags are how we make section levels of a document

## Next Level
### Next Level
#### Fourth Level
##### Fifth Level

# Basic Formatting

This is **BOLD.** (That's double asterisks). Or *italics*. or `code`.

 - This is the start of a list. 
 - Next item 
 - Next item 
 - Next item. Make sure you have a space at the end of each item. 
 
 1. this is a numbered list
 2. second item
 
 To add a hyperlink, do `[link text](url)` without backticks.
 For example, [go here](https://www.sewanee.edu)
 
 To link to sections of your document, do `[link text](#section-name)` without 
 backticks, with hyphnes for spaces, and everything lower-cased. For example, 
 [go here](#Next Level).
 
 To add more vertical space between blocks of text, use this "&nbsp;" without 
 quotes.
 
 &nbsp;
 
 &nbsp;
 
 should be more space now.
 
 **To include an image -- fun!**
 first put an image inside the folder with your `rmd` file is located
 Then type `![](full_image_filename_here){width = "50%"}`
 
 ![](../images/Screenshot 2024-11-03 180338.png){width="50%"}
 
 
 # RMarkdown 
 
`RMarkdown` is just `Markdown` with `R` code woven in.

You can do R stuff in the same line as text. For example, `r 3+3` will show as 6.
(It would like like backtick lowercase r, space, then code, then backtick).

You can also do a full multi-line CHUNK of R stuff.:
 
```{r chunk-name }
#```{r }
3+3
#```
```


Settings to control how R chunks appear:

- `eval = TRUE`: which actually runs the code; if `FALSE`, it shows the code but
doesn't run it. 
- `echo = TRUE`: which shows the code; if `FALSE`, the code can run without being
seen.
- `warnings = FALSE`: which will turn off warnings.

- `fig.cap = "Figure caption"` adds a figure caption.
-`fig.width = 7` example of figure width
-`fig.height = 4` example of figure height


```{r, eval=FALSE}
3+3
```  
 
 
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
#this will be evaluated but not shown
4+4
```

# Bringing in real data

To manually set working directory while building up my Rmarkdown file, just go
to Session > Set working directory > source file location.

```{r read data, }
library(readr)
energy<-read_csv("../data/IRENA data.csv", skip=1)
```
```{r explore data, }
library(dplyr)
energy %>% names
energy %>% head
energy %>% tail
energy %>% pull(Technology) %>% unique %>% sort
energy %>% pull('Country/area') %>% unique
```

```{r filter dataset, }
fenergy<- energy %>% 
  filter(`Country/area` == "United States of America (the)")
View(fenergy)
```

```{r plots}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
p<-ggplot(fenergy, 
       aes(x=Year,
           y=as.numeric(`Electricity statistics`),
           fill=Technology))+
  geom_area()

ggplotly(p)
```
